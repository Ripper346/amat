\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
% ==========================================================
To make the paper self-contained, we include a brief review of two basic concepts that our work is based on.

\subsubsection*{Medial Axis Transform}
Consider a two-dimensional binary shape, $O$, in the image plane, and its boundary $\Theta_O$.
The \emph{medial axis} of $O$ is the set of points $\vec{p}$ that lie midway between two sections of 
its boundary. The points $\vec{p}$ are the centers of maximally inscribed disks, bitangent to $\Theta_O$
in the interior of the shape. The radius $r(\vec{p})$ of the disk is the distance between $\vec{p}$ and 
the points where the disk touches $\Theta_O$, and is called the \emph{medial radius}.
Based on the above definitions, the \emph{medial axis transform} is the process of 
mapping $O$ to the set of tuples $(\vec{p},r(\vec{p})) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$.
Given these pairs, we can fully reconstruct the object as a union of overlapping disks that sweep-out 
the object's interior. 

\subsubsection*{Weighted Geometric Set Cover}
The geometric set cover is the extension of the well studied set cover problem, in a geometric space.
For simplicity, here we only consider the case of a two-dimensional space and we particularly focus in the 
\emph{weighted} version of the problem, which is defined as follows:
Consider a universe of $n$ points $set{X} \in \R^2$ and a family of sets 
$\set{D} = \{D_1,D_2,\ldots,D_m\} \subseteq \set{X}$. 
A common choice for these sets are intersections of $\set{X}$ and simple shape primitives, such as disks or rectangles.

Now assume that each set in $\set{D}$ is associated with a non-negative weight or \emph{cost} $c_i$.
Solving the WGSC problem amounts to finding a sub-collection $\bar{\set{D}} \in \set{D}$ that covers the entire $\set{X}$
(all $n$ elements of $\set{X}$ are contained in at least one set in $\bar{\set{D}}$), while having the minimum
total cost $C$; the total cost is simply the sum of costs of individual elements in $\bar{\set{D}}$.

WGSC is an NP-hard problem for which several polynomial-time approximate solutions (PTAS) exist~\cite{PTAS algos for WGSC}.
Perhaps the simplest and more straightforward is the greedy algorithm described in~\cite{Vazirani}. 
\stavros{We will include pseudocode for the algorithm applied in our own problem}
The interested reader can find more details on the WGSC and related algorithms in~\cite{other WGSC works}.

\subsection{AMAT as a Geometric Set Cover Problem}

\subsection{Extending AMAT to Textured Images}
\begin{itemize}
\item $L_0$ Smoothing
\item GANs (if that works)
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
% ==========================================================
\subsection{Image Reconstruction}
Experiments on image reconstruction using standard metrics (MSE, PSNR, and metrics using CNN feature similarity.

\subsubsection*{Abstract Scenes}

\subsubsection*{BSDS500}
This can only be done if we can make the GAN work and generate texture.

\subsection{Medial Point Detection (BMAX500)}\label{sec:medial-point-detection}
Recover all medial axes of the BSDS500. Compare with other skeletonization algorithms, such
as the CNN based method, and my previous MIL-based method

\subsection{Boundary Detection (BSDS500)}\label{sec:boundary-detection}
Medial axes to boundaries. 
MIL: compute an approximate scale based on the scale with maximum probability and try to recover boundaries.
CNN: same as above, this was already done in that paper for estimating segmentation masks using scale information.
We can compare the boundary recovery results as well.
EDGE DETECTORS: Standard edge detection algorithms (Dollar, HED, Canny, gPB etc: compare with algorithms specifically
tailored for this task. WE ARE NOT EXPECTING SOTA PERFORMANCE.
