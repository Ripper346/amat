\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
In this supplemental material we include details and qualitative results that we could not include in the main submission due to the limited space.
\stavros{Complete depending on the material we add. Don't forget to include the video.}


\section{Complexity Analysis and How}\label{sec:complexity}
First, we re-define some useful quantities to make the supplemental material self-contained.
We consider a finite set of radii $r\in \scales : \{r_1,\ldots,r_R \}$, and a disk of radius $r_j$, centered at point $\p{i}\in X^I$,
is denoted as $D_{\p{i},r_j} = D_{ij}$.
The most computationally demanding step in our method is the computation of the disk costs
\begin{equation}
c_{ij} = \sum_k \sum_l \norm{\f{ij} - \f{kl} }^2 \quad \forall k,l: D_{kl} \subset D_{ij}.
\label{eq:diskcost}
\end{equation}
This quantity must be computed at all location-radius combinations, and for all the contained disks, of radii $r\in\scales$.

To simplify computations, we consider the continuous case.
